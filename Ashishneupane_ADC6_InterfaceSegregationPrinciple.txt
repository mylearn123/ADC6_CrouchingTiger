SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. It’s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:

Single Responsibility Principle
Open/Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle

Dependency Inversion
All of them are broadly used and worth knowing. But in this first post of my series about the SOLID principles, I will focus on the first one: the Single Responsibility Principle.

Example:
The "Liskov's Substitution Principle" is just a way of ensuring that
inheritance is used correctly
• Ostrich is a Bird (definitely it is!) and hence it inherits the Bird class.
Now, can it fly?

Solution:
So, even if in real world this seems natural, in the class design, Ostrich
should not inherit the Bird class, and there should be a separate class
for birds that can't really fly and Ostrich should inherit that.
