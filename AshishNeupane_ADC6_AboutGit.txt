About Git


Git clone:
	Git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, 
or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use 
cases of git clone.


Git pull:
	Git pull is a Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote.
Git pull fetches the new commits and merges (git merge) these into your local branch.


Git push:
	The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 
Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. 


Git Branch:
	Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems.In Git, branches are a part 
of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug. No matter how big or how smal.you spawn a new branch 
to encapsulate your changes. 


Git merge:
	Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate
them into a single branch. Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch. 
The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected.


Merge conflict:
	Merging and conflicts are a common part of the Git experience.Conflicts generally arise when two 
people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was 
modifying it. In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affect the 
developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict. Git will mark the file as being
 conflicted and halt the merging process. It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.
