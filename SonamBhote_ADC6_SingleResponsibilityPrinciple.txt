S
It refers to single responsibitiy principle. In which a class should have one and only one responsibility.Example: Problems:
Class A handles lot of operations.
Suppose any of the following change happens in future like :
New database
Adopt ORM to manage queries in the database
Change in output structure
So in all the cases the above class would be changed.
Which might affect the implementation of the other two operations as  well.
Solution:
	So ideally according to SRP there should be three classes  each having the single responsibility.
